# Security

Allowing people to execute their own SQL directly against your database is risky business!

Configured correctly, Django SQL Dashboard uses a number of measures to keep your data and your database server safe:

- I strongly recommend creating a dedicated PostgreSQL role for accessing your database with read-only permissions granted to an allow-list of tables. PostgreSQL has extremely robust, well tested permissions which this tool can take full advantage of.
- Likewise, configuring a PostgreSQL-enforced query time limit can reduce the risk of expensive queries affecting the performance of the rest of your site.
- Setting up a read-only reporting replica for use with this tool can provide even stronger isolation from other site traffic.
- Your allow-list of tables should not include tables with sensitive information. Django's auth_user table contains password hashes, and the django_session table contains user session information. Neither should be exposed using this tool.
- Access to the dashboard is controlled by Django's permissions system, which means you can limit access to trusted team members.
- SQL queries can be passed to the dashboard using a ?sql= query string parameter - but this parameter needs to be signed before it will be executed. This should prevent attempts to trick you into executing malevolent SQL queries by sending you crafted links - while still allowing your team to create links to queries that can be securely shared.
- Any time a user views a dashboard page while logged in, `Cache-Control: private` is set on the response to ensure the authenticated dashboard will not be stored in any intermediary HTTP caches
